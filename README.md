## Firewall

This is a beginning not an end. This is a collection of Bash scripts for iptables. Sure, FWBuilder is nice. But if you're like me you WANT to understand as much as you can about something. Having something function is a failure. Understanding everything about it is success.

### Files
```
README.md - this
docs - Some iptables documentation

display_iptables.bash - Displays tables
launch_flush.bash - Flush the tables
